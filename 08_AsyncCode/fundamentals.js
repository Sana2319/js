// > Default js -> 
//     1. Synchronous: ek code execute hone k baad dusra code execute hoga
//     2. Single threaded language: lil bit slow

// > Execution Context: execute one line of code at a time
//     -> each operation wait for the last one to complete before executing

// > Blocking Code:  Block the flow of program  => read file sync  e.g. in registration to send user syccessful it's necessary to have blocking code
//   Non Blocking Code: Does not block execution => read file async
